# Overview

This project demonstrates various color manipulations on images. The following functionalities are implemented:

Grayscale Conversion: Convert a color image to grayscale using proper RGB coefficients and compare with an averaging method.

Color Quantization: Reduce the number of colors in an image using quantization techniques.

Hue, Saturation, Brightness, and Lightness Adjustments: Modifying color properties while maintaining valid ranges.

CIEDE Color Closeness Algorithm: Identify similar colors using the DeltaE metric based on a selected reference color.
